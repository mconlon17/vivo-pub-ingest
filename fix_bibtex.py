    fix_bibtex.py -- fix a bibtex file

    Thomson Reuters Bibtex has several errors that violate bibtex sytax and
    choke bibtex parsers.  These are:
      1.  Double brackets should be replaced with single brackets throughout.
          For example, Thomson Reuters often uses Year = {{1988}}.  Should be
          Year = {1988}
      2.  Bibtex keywords must not contain blanks.  Thomson Reuters asserts
          Web of Science Category = {...}  All assertions should be changed to
          Web-of-Science-Category = {...}
          Meeting Abstract should be changed to Meeting-Abstract = {...}
      3.  The values for Funding-Acknowledgement often (about 30% of the time)
          include a meaningless escape sequence \{[}\} which confuses the
          parser.  This string of six characters should be replaced everywhere
          with a single space.

    In addition, Thomson Reuters uses a series of abbreviations for journal
    names and publishers that can be improved on a case by case basis.

    This program reads a file of improvements, and a bibtex file from stdin,
    makes the improvements that need to be made, and writes an improved
    file to stdout

    Version 1.0 2012-08-25 MC
    --  Added additional publisher name corrections
    Version 1.1 2014-01-13 MC
    --  All data moved to a CSV file
    --  Conform with commenting and coding standards
