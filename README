Publication Ingest

Python version used: 2.7.6

# Get weekly batch of papers from Thomson Reuters: The batch of papers
# is renewed every friday. So to get a weekly batch of papers, the
# papers should be downloaded every thursday and saved in the format of
# tr_mm_dd_yyyy_wk.bib where mm_dd_yyyy is the respective date for
# Monday in the next week (Monday when you are going to run the
# publication ingest)
# 
STEPS 1. Go to "http://isiknowledge.com/wos"

2. Go to "Advanced Search"

3. Paste the Query "AD=(University Florida OR Univ Florida OR UFL OR
UF)" in the search box. It will list the papers affiliated to the
University of Florida. The time range will determine the papers to be
downloaded.


4. Below the search box, there are the following options to give time
limits. -dropdown menu (gives the papers based on year, month, three
weeks or last week etc.) -from 'year' to 'year' (gives range from a
particular year to the desired year, for eg. 2008 to  2010)

 So now because the query is run on thursday, then the first drop down
 option is used which allows to list papers for latest week "Current
 week".


5. Hit search. It gives the batch of papers entered in Thomson Reuters
in the last week. Click on the batch of papers. Lists all the papers
with titles.


6. On top of the papers, the options "Send to" has a drop down menu arrow,
choose "other file formats". -Records :all records on page records from
__ to __ (Select this option and enter the number of papers to be
downloaded. For eg. if papers are 143, then range should be 1 to 143)
-Content : select "Full Record" -Format  : Choose Bibtex Hit "Send"


7. The file will be saved in the downloads as "savedrecs.bib". Rename the file as tr_mm_dd_yyyy_wk.bib. tr stands for
Thomson Reuters, mm for month, dd for the date and yyyy for year, wk is
for weekly (the date should be the monday when the ingest is to be
done). Save the file in the data subdirectory.


# Now, the first step is done. After you have the bibtex file, the file
# should be processed through various python files to get the final RDF,
# report and text file with all the titles added and respective DOIs.
# 
# Open the terminal window. (in mac: Launchpad>Utilities>Terminal ; in
# windows: open the start menu, type "cmd" and press enter, a terminal
# window opens). 

1. Run the shell script pub_ingest.sh. First the file will be processed by fix-bibtex.py, then by read-bibtex.py, and finally bibtex2.rdf will generate output RDF.


2. Open the report. There is a publisher report at the very top, and
tells how many new publishers were created. Check each of the publishers
created in the final report and search for the publisher(may be in
abbreviations) in the original bibtex file i.e. tr_mm_dd_yyyy_wk.bib.
The possible abbreviations are listed in the file vivotools.py.

3. Open the fix_bibtex.csv file with editor. It consists of all the
publishers with their abbreviations and corrected names.

#For eg.
#
    ADIS INT LTD|ADIS INTERNATIONAL LIMITED

The first part is the abbreviation of the publisher by which it was
added to VIVO initially. However, it is replaced by the correct and full
name.

In your report, find the abbreviated name of the publisher created in
the original bibtex file. Find the correct name of the publisher from
internet (Google etc.). In the fix_bibtex.csv, put the abbreviated name
and the corrected name of the publisher in the same format as above.
Repeat the process for all the publishers created (if the abbreviated
name is different from the correct name).

Save the file.

4. Re-run the process using the script (same previous commands: Step 1.
No need to change the pathname again).

You should have all the final five files now, output to the data subdirectory: tr_mm_dd_yyyy_wk.bib ;
tr_mm_dd_yyyy_wk_fin.bib ; tr_mm_dd_yyyy_wk_fin.rpt ;
tr_mm_dd_yyyy_wk_fin.lst ; tr_mm_dd_yyyy_wk_fin.rdf


5. Upload the RDF.

	a. Open "vivo.ufl.edu". Log into your account (You must have Editor
	rights to be able to upload RDF)

	b. On the top right corner of the screen, click on "Siteadmin".

	c. Siteadmin > Add/Remove RDF Data (Under "Advanced Data Tools")

	d. It gives you an option to choose a file to upload. Click on the
	option and choose the RDF "tr_mm_dd_yyyy_wk_fin.rdf

	e. Click "Submit"

	It takes 10-15 min to upload the RDF depending on the size of the
	file. When the upload is complete, the message will appear "RDF
	upload successful"



6. After the  upload is successful, the VIVO-Editor list should be
notified about the update with the umber of publications added and the
titles added.

	a. The mail should be sent to : " VIVO-EDITORS-L@lists.ufl.edu "
	with subject in format "'n' publications added to VIVO" (n stands
	for for the number of publications added)

	b. The exact number of publications added is given in the report as
	"publication created"

	b. The format of the mail should be:



		Hello,

		'n' publications have been added to VIVO. The publications are
		from the latest week batch. The titles are listed below.



		Regards,

		Your Name



		Copy paste the whole .lst file contents.

	d. Send out the mail.



#Disambiguation Cases: In the final report, at the very bottom, there is
#a whole list of the disambiguation cases. These are the cases where the
#publication added had an author similar to one existing in VIVO and the
#program could not identify the right author to attach the publication.
#Mostly, the links in disambiguation report are the stubs of a main
#profile. So, to remove these, you will need to merge the stubs to the
#main profile.
#
#
#
1. The report gives the URI where the publication is located. Below that
there is the name of the author and at least two URIs between which the
publication might be attached to.



2. Open the publication URI. Now open the author URIs listed below in
other tabs. There can be two cases:

	a. The URIs belong to the same person but are stubs (duplicate
	profiles which dont have UFID on them).In this case, find the main
	profile for the person and merge all the stubs to the main profile.
	For merging, follow the steps below:

		Siteadmin > Ingest Tools > Merge Resources

		A page opens allowing you to merge two different URIs. The first
		one is primary and below is secondary. Paste the main profile
		URI in the primary resource and URIs of the stub profiles in the
		secondary resource space one by one.

	b. The dismabiguation can be between two main profiles from
	different department. This will need your judgement regarding where
	and to which of the profiles, the publication should be linked to.
	This can be decided by matching the department of the person and the
	publication.

3. The process is repeated for every disambiguation case in the report.
